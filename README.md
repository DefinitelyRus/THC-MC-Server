## ▶ PlayIt (Simplest) ◀
If you just want to play and don't care too much about some network lag, this is the simplest way to join and start playing.

1. Choose the IP address and port for your edition of Minecraft.
2. Add it to your server list.
3. Click join!

### IP Addresses

| Platform | IP Address | Port |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Java | `name-condo.gl.joinmc.link` | `24156` |
| Bedrock | `remote-regardless.gl.at.ply.gg` | `38641` |

## ZeroTier One (Faster Connection)

If you want better performance while playing, you can connect via a VPN to skip relaying through PlayIt. This reduces the latency between your device and the server. However, some setup is required.

# Versions
Thanks to ViaBackwards, y'all should be able to join with any Minecraft release since `1.9`.

Similarly, ViaVersion allows newer versions (e.g., `1.21.11`) to join the server, which is still running `1.21.10` due to plugin support.

> Note: Certain blocks, entities, and behavior might be different; the plugin is trying to emulate them as accurately as possible without requiring mods.

# Don't have Minecraft?
## Java
Try [this launcher](https://mc-launcher.com/wp/minecraft/) I used to use for years! As always, do so at your own risk.

## Bedrock
Buy it or ask someone to buy it for you. Cracked Bedrock clients cannot join at this time.
