general:

  # Please do not change this value as it may cause the file to be reset.
  # Default: "1.5"
  configVersion: "1.5"

  # If you want to see a detailed loading message when the plugin is loading, set this to true. (Also works for unloading)
  # Default: false
  detailedLoading: false

  # Do you want to check for updates of the plugin?
  # Default: true
  checkForUpdates: true

  # Time zone ID used for displaying time-related information in the plugin.
  # Leave this blank to use the server's default time zone.
  # Example values: "America/New_York", "Europe/Paris", "Asia/Tokyo"
  # Default: ""
  dateTimezone: ""


  # Default text of input when using anvil way to enter text.
  # Default: "Type here"
  anvilTypeHereText: "Type here"

  # Minimum and maximum length for names entered by players.
  # ⚠️ Warning: Payers can bypass these limits if they use the defaults commands of EssentialsX.
  #             This only applies to names and not to display names, icons, etc.
  # Default: min = 3, max = 32
  minNameLength: 3
  maxNameLength: 32

  # Set this to true if you want to open the kit admin view by default when the /kit command is performed for players
  # with permission to see the admin view.
  # Default: false

  # Set this to true if you want to open the warp admin view by default when the /warp command is performed for players
  # with permission to see the admin view.
  # Default: false

  # Delay (in seconds) for typing in chat before the input is canceled.
  # This is used when players are required to type something in chat (like a name).
  # Default: 10
  delayForTypingInChat: 10

  # Set this to true if you want to instantly create a home/kit/warp when the player
  # click on the create button, without asking for information like name in chat or anvil.
  # TIP: If you accept bedrock players, I recommend you to set this to true. Because bedrock players
  #      typing in chat can be complicated for them. You can always change the name/icon later using the GUI.
  # Default: false
  skipDataEntryProcess: false

  # Configure the default names used when skipDataEntryProcess (instant creation) is enabled.
  # You must use %number% placeholder to indicate where the number will be placed. (e.g., home_1, home_2, etc.)
  # If you don't use %number%, the same home/kit/warp will be overwritten each time a new one is created.
  # Please just use lowercase letters, numbers and underscores. No spaces or special characters. These names will be
  # used as internal names for EssentialsX, so they must follow EssentialsX 'naming rules'. If you don't know
  # what that means, just use simple names like the ones provided by default.
